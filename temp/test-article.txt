TITLE: Man builds fully functional hovercraft from 6 leaf blowers and a kiddie pool - reaches 25mph

FULL TEXT:
A Tennessee man has gone viral after posting a video of his homemade hovercraft, constructed entirely from hardware store materials over the course of three weekends.

Mark Davidson, 34, a mechanical engineer from Knoxville, says the project cost him approximately $340 in total. The build uses six Worx 20V cordless leaf blowers mounted to a wooden frame, with a modified plastic kiddie pool serving as the hull and skirt.

"I'd been watching hovercraft videos for years and finally decided to just try it," Davidson told local news. "The hardest part was actually the skirt design—I went through three different materials before landing on the pool liner approach."

The craft weighs approximately 85 pounds empty and can support a rider up to 200 pounds. Davidson claims a top speed of 25 mph on flat grass, though he admits he's only tested it in his backyard and an empty parking lot.

Safety concerns have been raised in the comments. The leaf blowers run at approximately 400 CFM each, creating significant noise levels that Davidson estimates at "around 95 decibels, maybe more." He wears ear protection during operation.

Battery life is the main limitation—the six leaf blowers drain their batteries in roughly 12-15 minutes of continuous operation. Davidson has purchased additional battery packs but notes the cost adds up quickly.

"It's not practical transportation," he acknowledges. "But that was never the point. It's just fun."

The video has accumulated over 2 million views on TikTok, with many commenters asking for build tutorials. Davidson says he's considering posting a detailed breakdown but wants to add more safety disclaimers first.

Local authorities have reminded residents that operating homemade vehicles on public roads or waterways may require permits and safety inspections.

SUMMARY:
Tennessee engineer builds $340 hovercraft from 6 leaf blowers and a kiddie pool, reaching 25mph. Main issues: 95dB noise levels, 12-15 minute battery life. Video went viral with 2M TikTok views. He admits "it's not practical transportation" but plans to post build tutorials with safety disclaimers.
