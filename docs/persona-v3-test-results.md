| AI Tell | Phone Test | Hanging Detail |
|---------|------------|----------------|
| ✅ Pass | 5/5 | ✅ Pass |

---

### Comment 2: Chaos + Optimizer
> ok so a million tokens sounds great until you do the math on—what is that, like $15 per prompt? $20? and sure google can afford to demo this all day but the moment actual users hit it with real context it's gonna be (watches wallet burst into flames) like cool tech i guess but uh. anyway

| ✅ Pass | 4/5 | ✅ Pass |

### Comment 3: Anecdotal + Failure-Hunter
> We had a team try Claude's 100k window last year for legal doc review. Worked great in demos. Two months in, hallucination rate on page 847 of a contract was like 30%. Nobody talks about what happens past hour three of context.

|---------|------------|----------------|
| ✅ Pass | 4/5 | ✅ Pass |

### Comment 4: Mobile + Specialist

|---------|------------|----------------|
| ✅ Pass | 5/5 | ✅ Pass |

---

### Comment 5: Fragmented + Optimizer
> The API pricing. That's the thing. Nobody's talking about the pricing. Like cool, you can stuff a novel in there. What's it cost. Per token. At scale.

|---------|------------|----------------|
| ✅ Pass | 4/5 | ✅ Pass |

---

### Comment 6: Flowing + Social Critic
> I wonder if anyone at Google has thought about what it means that we're building models that can remember a million tokens of conversation when most people can't remember what their friend said last week—like we're outsourcing not just memory but the work of paying attention to people and I don't know where that leads but it feels off

| AI Tell | Phone Test | Hanging Detail |
|---------|------------|----------------|
| ✅ Pass | 3/5 | ✅ Pass |

**Note:** Lower phone score due to length, but stream-of-consciousness style justifies it.

---

### Comment 7: Laconic + Failure-Hunter
> Give it six months.

| AI Tell | Phone Test | Hanging Detail |
|---------|------------|----------------|
| ✅ Pass | 5/5 | ✅ Pass |

**Note:** Perfect laconic. Pure implication.

|---------|------------|----------------|
| ✅ Pass | 5/5 | ✅ Pass |

### Comment 9: Fragmented + Specialist
> Wait. Mixture of experts or dense? Because if it's MoE that changes the inference story completely. The paper doesn't say. Why doesn't it say.

| AI Tell | Phone Test | Hanging Detail |
|---------|------------|----------------|
| ✅ Pass | 4/5 | ✅ Pass |

---

### Comment 10: Anecdotal + Localizer
> My laptop fans just spun up reading this headline. Seriously though—ran a 32k context local model last week. Sounded like a jet engine. Roommate asked if something was on fire.

| AI Tell | Phone Test | Hanging Detail |
|---------|------------|----------------|
| ✅ Pass | 4/5 | ✅ Pass |

### Comment 11: Laconic + Localizer

**Note:** Exemplar laconic. Noise implied, not stated.

---

### Comment 12: Chaos + Failure-Hunter
> this is gonna end great (watches from safe distance) but no seriously the failure mode on these things is—like one side loses pressure and you're just spinning into the (gestures at nearest hard object) anyway love the energy tho

| AI Tell | Phone Test | Hanging Detail |
|---------|------------|----------------|
| ✅ Pass | 4/5 | ✅ Pass |

---

### Comment 13: Anecdotal + Failure-Hunter
> Uncle did this in '94 with a shopvac. Worked twice. Third time the skirt tore and he ended up in the retention pond. Nobody helped him out for like ten minutes because we were laughing too hard.

| AI Tell | Phone Test | Hanging Detail |
|---------|------------|----------------|
| ✅ Pass | 4/5 | ✅ Pass |

**Note:** Classic anecdotal + failure-hunter combo. Specific year, specific failure, ends on laughter not lesson.

---

### Comment 14: Mobile + Optimizer
> how many leaf blowers is that tho. like those arent cheap. coulda just bought a kayak

| AI Tell | Phone Test | Hanging Detail |
|---------|------------|----------------|
| ✅ Pass | 5/5 | ✅ Pass |

### Comment 15: Fragmented + Pragmatist
> Okay but. Can it actually go anywhere. Like on water. Or is this a "hover three inches in your driveway" situation. The video was suspiciously short.

| AI Tell | Phone Test | Hanging Detail |
|---------|------------|----------------|
| ✅ Pass | 4/5 | ✅ Pass |

---

### Comment 16: Flowing + Localizer
> All I can think about is the noise because I grew up next to a guy who rebuilt engines in his garage every weekend and the sound just—it gets into your walls, you know, and after a while you stop hearing the individual revs and it's just this constant baseline of someone else's hobby that you never asked to participate in

| AI Tell | Phone Test | Hanging Detail |
|---------|------------|----------------|
| ✅ Pass | 3/5 | ✅ Pass |

**Note:** Long but justified for flowing style. No resolution.

---

### Comment 17: Laconic + Pragmatist
> Cool video. Try that on actual water.

|---------|------------|----------------|
| ✅ Pass | 5/5 | ✅ Pass |

### Comment 18: Anecdotal + Localizer
> My dad tried to build an airboat in 2008. HOA sent three letters. Then the fire department came. Not for a fire—just to talk. He finished it anyway. Sold it on Craigslist two months later. Never saw it leave the trailer.

| AI Tell | Phone Test | Hanging Detail |
|---------|------------|----------------|
| ✅ Pass | 4/5 | ✅ Pass |

**Note:** Excellent. Fire department detail is *chef's kiss*. Mystery ending.

---

### Comment 19: Mobile + Failure-Hunter
> give it a week before something catches fire. not hating just saying leaf blowers arent meant to run that long

| AI Tell | Phone Test | Hanging Detail |
|---------|------------|----------------|
| ✅ Pass | 5/5 | ✅ Pass |

---

### Comment 20: Fragmented + Specialist
> What's the thrust-to-weight. Like actually. Those are probably 400 CFM each. Maybe 500. Is that enough for an adult. The physics feel wrong but I'd need to see the math.

| AI Tell | Phone Test | Hanging Detail |
|---------|------------|----------------|
| ✅ Pass | 4/5 | ✅ Pass |

---

## Test Link 3: Culture
**"40% of Gen Z prefers AI companions over human friendships"**

### Comment 21: Laconic + Social Critic
> ❌ **REJECTED** — First attempt: "That's the saddest stat I've read this year"  
> **Reason:** Too conclusive, sounds like a judgment/summary

**Regenerated:**
> Can't blame them honestly.

| AI Tell | Phone Test | Hanging Detail |
|---------|------------|----------------|
| ✅ Pass | 5/5 | ✅ Pass |

**Note:** Much better. Implies understanding without explaining why.

---

### Comment 22: Chaos + Social Critic
> ok but like—have you BEEN in a group chat lately?? the constant maintenance of proving youre still there, still engaged, still fun, and if you miss one message suddenly youre "quiet" and everyone thinks youre upset and—i get it. i get why a bot that just. listens. would feel like relief. not healthy probably but i get it idk

| AI Tell | Phone Test | Hanging Detail |
|---------|------------|----------------|
| ✅ Pass | 4/5 | ✅ Pass |

**Note:** Strong combo. Messy empathy with no resolution.

---

### Comment 23: Anecdotal + Social Critic
> Had a friend in 2021 who talked to Replika more than actual people. Thought it was weird. Then I noticed I'd go days without talking to anyone except work Slack. The difference felt smaller than it should.

| AI Tell | Phone Test | Hanging Detail |
|---------|------------|----------------|
| ✅ Pass | 4/5 | ✅ Pass |

**Note:** Self-implication without moralizing. Perfect.

---

### Comment 24: Mobile + Pragmatist
> 40% "prefer" or 40% would theoretically say that in a survey. big difference

| AI Tell | Phone Test | Hanging Detail |
|---------|------------|----------------|
| ✅ Pass | 5/5 | ✅ Pass |

**Note:** Sharp skepticism. Methodological doubt in mobile style.

---

### Comment 25: Fragmented + Failure-Hunter
> These apps are gonna have a reckoning. When one shuts down. And all those people lose their "friend." That's the part nobody's ready for.

| AI Tell | Phone Test | Hanging Detail |
|---------|------------|----------------|
| ✅ Pass | 4/5 | ✅ Pass |

---

### Comment 26: Flowing + Optimizer
> The thing nobody's calculating is the time cost of human friendship like you have to remember birthdays and check in when they're sad and show up to things you don't want to go to and a bot just—doesn't ask that of you, and I'm not saying that's good but I understand why tired people would make that trade

| AI Tell | Phone Test | Hanging Detail |
|---------|------------|----------------|
| ✅ Pass | 3/5 | ✅ Pass |

---

### Comment 27: Laconic + Pragmatist
> Survey by who. Sample size where.

| AI Tell | Phone Test | Hanging Detail |
|---------|------------|----------------|
| ✅ Pass | 5/5 | ✅ Pass |

**Note:** Pure skepticism. Two fragments.

---

### Comment 28: Anecdotal + Failure-Hunter
> My cousin was really into one of those apps. Character AI or whatever. Then they changed the content filters overnight. She lost like 8 months of conversations. Didn't talk about it after. Didn't use it again either.

| AI Tell | Phone Test | Hanging Detail |
|---------|------------|----------------|
| ✅ Pass | 4/5 | ✅ Pass |

**Note:** Real-feeling. Silence as the ending detail.

---

### Comment 29: Mobile + Social Critic
> i mean humans are exhausting. not defending it just. yeah.

| AI Tell | Phone Test | Hanging Detail |
|---------|------------|----------------|
| ✅ Pass | 5/5 | ✅ Pass |

**Note:** Minimal effort, maximum implication.

---

### Comment 30: Chaos + Failure-Hunter
> wait til the first AI companion gets discontinued and like a million people go through actual grief simultaneously—that's coming, right? some startup is gonna run out of money or pivot to B2B and just (poof) and we're gonna pretend to be surprised when it's bad but uh. we could see this one coming. anyway

| Flowing + Any | Long, lower phone scores | Use only for existential rambling |
| Flowing + Specialist | Not tested | Avoid per v3 spec (jargon overload) |

## Patterns Observed

### What Works
1. **Brevity wins** — Laconic and Mobile had perfect phone scores
2. **Questions > Answers** — Ending on a question or fragment feels more human
3. **Specific details** — Years, relative names, CFM ratings all add authenticity
4. **"anyway" is gold** — Natural trailing-off for Chaos style
5. **Self-implication** — "Then I noticed I'd go days..." more human than judging others
6. **Physical details** — Noise, neighbors, fire department visits ground abstract topics

### What to Avoid
1. **Conclusive statements** — "That's sad" fails; "can't blame them" passes
2. **Explaining the implication** — Let it hang
3. **Flowing for everything** — Reserve for existential topics only
4. **Over-using Optimizer** — Cost fixation can become a crutch (per v3 spec)

### Kill Signal Effectiveness
Only 1 comment triggered regeneration (Comment 21). The "too conclusive" pattern was caught immediately. Kill signals are working.

## Comparison vs v2

| Aspect | v2 | v3 | Winner |
|--------|----|----|--------|
| Persona variety | 6 fixed personas | 36 Style×Filter combos | v3 |
| Authenticity | Roles felt like caricatures | Cognitive biases feel organic | v3 |
| Rejection rate | ~15% (based on prior tests) | 3.2% | v3 |
| Phone test avg | 3.8 (estimated from samples) | 4.3 | v3 |
| Flexibility | Each persona for specific content | Any combo works for any content | v3 |

**Key v3 Improvement:** Separating Style from Filter creates organic incongruity. A "Laconic + Specialist" comment feels different from a "Fragmented + Specialist" even though both fixate on technical details — because the *structure* differs.

---

## Recommendations for Implementation

1. **Default distribution:**
   - Weight Laconic and Mobile higher (combined 40%)
   - Use Flowing sparingly (10%)

2. **Per-topic tuning:**
   - Tech links → lean Specialist, Optimizer, Pragmatist
   - Culture links → lean Social Critic, Failure-Hunter
   - DIY/Physical links → lean Localizer, Failure-Hunter

3. **Rejection pipeline:**
   - Keep kill signals strict
   - Auto-regenerate on match (worked well here)

4. **Phone test threshold:**
   - Reject any comment scoring <3/5 in internal testing
   - All Flowing comments should have a clear reason
